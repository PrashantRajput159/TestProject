Provides
cleaner API and pluggable Adapters:
  * Socket adapter, based on old HTTP_Request code,
  * Curl adapter, wraps around PHP's cURL extension,
  * Mock adapter, to use for testing packages dependent on HTTP_Request2.
Supports POST requests with data and file uploads, basic and digest
authentication, cookies, managing cookies across requests, proxies, gzip and
deflate encodings, redirects, monitoring the request progress with Observers...";s:2:"da";s:19:"2016-02-13 15:24:52";s:1:"n";s:1638:"New features:
 * New observer that can do on-the-fly decoding of compressed responses,
   see HTTP_Request2_Observer_UncompressingDownload.
   Thanks to Delian Krustev for initial implementation.
 * CookieJar can now silently ignore invalid cookies with $jar->ignoreInvalidCookies(true);
   instead of throwing an exception. See requests #19937 and #20401
 * Adapters now dispatch a new 'warning' event, e.g. in case of incomplete response
   body or broken 'chunked' encoding. Exception was thrown previously by Socket adapter
   in the latter case, see bug #20228
 * Improved security of HTTPS requests in Socket adapter
   - Use 'tls://' instead of 'ssl://' in connection string to prevent fallback to
     known insecure versions, use only TLS when enabling crypto via proxy (see bug #20462)
   - On PHP 5.6+ require using only TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2
   - Do not use insecure ciphers
 * Improved test suite, network-backed tests now run on Travis CI

Changes and fixes:
 * Curl adapter failed to send PUT request body with 'follow_redirects' on (bug #20440)
 * Curl adapter supplied invalid cookie domain to CookieJar after redirect (bug #20561)
 * Curl adapter now properly dispatches events while sending the request
 * mime_content_type() returning false was handled incorrectly when guessing content-type
 * Use 'peer_name' and 'verify_peer_name' SSL context options on PHP 5.6+
   instead of deprecated 'CN_match'
 * Public Suffix List updated to current version, its download location changed

Note to Composer users: next package version will probably get rid of 'include-path'
setting in composer.json favour of using autoloader.";s:1:"f";s:6:"119717";s:1:"g";s:43:"http://pear.php.net/get/HTTP_Request2-2.3.0";s:1:"x";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:17:"package.2.3.0.xml";}}}
